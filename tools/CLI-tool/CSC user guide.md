# SET UP GUIDE FOR CSC USER:

## I) CSC setup

1. Set up your account in [CSC](https://my.csc.fi/welcome) using HAKA Login (this might takes up to 30 minutes, so no worries if it doesn't allow you in instantly)
2. Create a new project, you should see a button to create new project either in your dashboard pane or in your project pane (this also might takes a while)
3. Once you had your own project you should be able to access it in your project pane
4. When you are in your project, scroll down and there should be a tab call "Services"
5. Add service and choose cPouta as the service to run
6. Login in to cPouta using haka (this also will takes a while)

## II) cPouta setup

### a) Security Group Setup
1. Once you are in cPouta navigate to Security Groups: Network -> Security Groups
2. Create a new security group (DO NOT MODIFY THE DEFAULT SECURITY GROUP IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING)
3. Once the new security group had been created you can modify the rule by press on Manage Rules
4. Create a new rule by press on "Add Rule"
5. Choose SSH as rule and leave the rest as it is.

For more information on what does all this step means please consult the [user guide make by CSC](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/launch-vm-from-web-gui/#setting-up-ssh-keys)

### b) Key Pairs Setup
1. Navigate to Key Pairs: Compute -> Key Pairs
2. Either import SSH key pair that you had made or create a new key pair by press on Create Key Pair
3. Name your key pair, try to name it in lower case, no space, and no special characters. Key type is SSH Key
**Important:** The key will be save automatically to your computer once you press "Create Key Pair". This will be the only way to access the computer so don't lose it. Type file should be ".pem" for window and linux, for mac it will be ".cer"

Again for more information please consult the [CSC user guide](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/launch-vm-from-web-gui/#setting-up-ssh-keys)

### c) Instances setup

## III) Connecting to cPouta machine from your local machine

### For Window user

1. You should install [Window Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
2. Move your key pairs that you have save in your computer from the earlier step into your linux environment under `home/<yourusername>/`

The rest of the setup will then be universal!

1. Locate and navigate your key path in your system
2. Change the permission by using the command: `chmod 400 <your_key_name>.pem` or `chmod 400 <your_key_name>.cer` on mac
3. ssh into your Virtual machine using the command line by using the command: `sudo ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 <your_username>@<your_IP> -i <your_key_name>.pem`
4. Once inside you should do `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade`
5. Then you should install docker LTS using the command `sudo apt install docker.io`
6. Check if you had install docker successfully by using `docker version`
7. Clone the Github repo into to the VM
8. go into the Github repo by using `cd`
**!!!<your_username> in this case actually `ubuntu` reason can be found with detail explaination in [CSC user guide](https://docs.csc.fi/cloud/pouta/connecting-to-vm/)**

**\---------This part is for the version of the project where there is error in the setup script\---------**

9. `cd` into scripts
10. Open `install_tools.sh` using either nano or vim
11. Replace the script with the script from this [link](https://github.com/makotosoul/oss-mlops-platform/blob/main/scripts/install_tools.sh)

**\---------End\---------**

12. Follow the rest of the tutorial in [Installation guide](https://github.com/Softala-MLOPS/oss-mlops-platform/blob/main/tools/CLI-tool/Installations%2C%20setups%20and%20usage.md#installations-setups-and-usage)
